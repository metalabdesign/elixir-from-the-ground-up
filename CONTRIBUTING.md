## Project Principles

### [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
Introduce syntax slowly. For example, anonymous function shorthand should be introduced
long after the long-form has been well-used.

### Practical
Use motivating examples when explaining new concepts. Theory can be extremely powerful,
however keeping things concrete at first helps keep people grounded, and provides
easy examples to adapt to project work.

### Encourage Self-Learning
Point to short, simple projects that learners can do on their own
